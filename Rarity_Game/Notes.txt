Name of game:
Venture / ? Station / Town Hero


Each Item has x stats where x is based on its rarity (Drop Value)
When merging you keep the stats each item has and just add them on.
Each item can only be merged with its own type. 10 item types

It provides a flat amount for PvE and a scaled amount for PvP
this allows for PvP to be closer between High loot players and low (other then gem sockets which is where stratigy comes in)
PvE you get the full stat amount (This will either be a dps check to get a certain amount of gold or maybe a vampire suriver type thing where time is more money)
